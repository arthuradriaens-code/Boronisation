title = {Wall conditioning in fusion devices and its influence on plasma performance},
journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Proper wall conditioning has turned out to be an essential element for achieving the highest possible plasma performance in present day fusion devices. The main issues are controlling the generation of plasma impurities, liberated by plasma - surface interactions, and controlling the recycling hydrogenic fluxes. The underlying mechanisms are discussed in this paper. The paper presents a review of the different wall conditioning methods. It focuses on low-Z wall coatings (beryllium evaporation, boronization, siliconization, lithium pellet injection) and on helium glow discharge cleaning and assesses their effects on fusion plasmas. New wall conditioning concepts, compatible with steady-state magnetic fields, are discussed in view of future large devices with superconducting coils.}

abstract = {The tungsten programme in ASDEX Upgrade is pursued towards a full high-Z device. The spectroscopic diagnostic of W has been extended and refined and the cooling factor of W has been re-evaluated. The W coated surfaces now represent a fraction of 65% of all plasma facing components (24.8 m2). The only two major components that are not yet coated are the strikepoint region of the lower divertor as well as the limiters at the low field side. While extending the W surfaces, the W concentration and the discharge behaviour have changed gradually pointing to critical issues when operating with a W wall: anomalous transport in the plasma centre should not be too low, otherwise neoclassical accumulation can occur. One very successful remedy is the addition of central RF heating at the 20–30% level. Regimes with low ELM activity show increased impurity concentration over the whole plasma radius. These discharges can be cured by increasing the ELM frequency through pellet ELM pacemaking or by higher heating power. Moderate gas puffing also mitigates the impurity influx and penetration, however, at the expense of lower confinement. The erosion yield at the low field side guard limiter can be as high as 10−3 and fast particle losses from NBI were identified to contribute a significant part to the W sputtering. Discharges run in the upper W coated divertor do not show higher W concentrations than comparable discharges in the lower C based divertor. According to impurity transport calculations no strong high-Z accumulation is expected for the ITER standard scenario as long as the anomalous transport is at least as high as the neoclassical one.}

abstract = {The use of tungsten (W) as material for plasma-facing components (PFM) in fusion devices is reviewed with respect to its plasma and material compatibility under burning plasmas conditions. Fusion-relevant plasma operation with W walls is characterised by the need to operate at high edge densities, no or moderate density peaking, and external tools to control the W transport in the plasma core. Several surface and material issues related with the high particle fluencies in fusion devices needs further R&D but are not considered from present view to seriously limit the use of W as PFM. Reliable control of Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) and disruptions is indispensable for the application of W, both to control the W transport in the edge and to avoid target melting in uncontrolled events which can seriously detoriate the operational performance of the device. For DEMO and reactors, the behaviour of W under large neutron fluencies has to be further clarified and measures must be developed to mitigate degradation of material properties by neutron damage.}

abstract = {Boronization is the plasmachemical deposition of thin boron/carbon or pure boron films onto the inner wall of a tokamak device. Since mid-April 1989 the ASDEX vessel has been boronized seven times in glow discharges, first with a gas mixture of 10% B2H6 + 10% CH4+80% He (A), once with 10% B2+90% H2 (B) and once with 10% B2H6+90% He (C). All boronization runs were done at room temperature vessel walls. Local surface analysis of the deposited layers yielded thicknesses of up to 2000Å. Boronization provided considerably improved plasma conditions. In ohmic discharges, reductions of CO by a factor of more than five in the divertor chamber and of two for H2O were observed, in relation to a reduction of oxygen by a factor of more than five as measured by spectroscopy, but the reduction of hydrocarbons was only marginal. Iron disappeared from the spectra and even copper, the target plate material, was significantly reduced. As a consequence, Zeff is < 1.5 for n¯e > 3 × 1019m−3. The density limit was improved by 25% (boronization A) and more (boronization B and C). The oxygen-diminishing effect of boron/carbon and pure boron layers was found to be longer lasting than the suppression of metal impurities. Deteriorated wall conditions occurred only after hundreds of discharges, including numerous additional heating shots with ICRH, NI, LH and combined scenarios, but pre-boronization conditions were never reached. The main emphasis of this paper is to describe the impact of boronization on aspects of plasma operation}

abstract = {A thin boron film has been applied to the DIII-D tokamak plasma facing surfaces to reduce impurity influx, particularly oxygen and carbon. A direct result of this surface modification was the observation of a regime of very high energy confinement, VH-mode, with confinement times from 1.5 to 2 times greater than predicted by the H-mode scaling relation for the same set of parameters. VH-mode discharges are characterized by low ohmic target densities, low edge neutral pressure, and reduced recycling. These conditions have reduced the collisionality ν* in the edge region producing a higher edge pressure gradient and a significant bootstrap current, up to 30% of the total current. We will describe the edge plasma properties after boronization including reductions in recycling inferred from measurements of τp*. In particular we will discuss the edge plasma conditions necessary for access to VH-mode including the boronization process and properties of the deposited film.}

The boron powder injection effectively conditioned the plasma-facing components, as shown by the reductions in low-Z and high-Z impurities and the global recycling level in the whole inner vessel, and suppressed the strong magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) activity in the plasma core. The improved wall conditions also resulted in an earlier transition from L- to H-mode.

abstract = {The liner and limiters of TEXTOR have been coated in situ with a boron containing carbon film using a RG discharge in a throughflow of 0.8 He + 0.1 B2H6 +0.1 CH4. The average film thickness was 30–50 nm, the ratio of boron and carbon in the layer was about 1:1 according to Auger Electron Spectroscopy. Subsequent tokamak discharges are characterized by a small fraction of radiated power (< 0.3) even during high power ICRF heating (2.6 MW, 1.6 s). A concomitant strong increase of the convective power loading of the limiters is observed. Values of Zeff lower than 1.2 are derived from conductivity measurements. The most prominent change in the impurity concentration compared to good conditions in a carbonized surrounding is measured for oxygen. The value OVI/n̄e of the OVI intensity normalized to the averaged plasma density ne decreases by more than a factor of four. The decrease in the oxygen content manifests itself also as a reduction of the CO and CO2 partial pressures measured during and after the discharge with a sniffer probe. The carbon levels are reduced by a factor of about two as measured by the normalized intensity CII/ne of the CII line and via the ratio of the C fluxes and deuterium fluxes measured at the limiter (CI/Dα). The wall shows a pronounced sorption of hydrogen from the plasma, easing the density control and the establishment of low recycling conditions. The beneficial conditions did not show a significant deterioration during more than 200 discharges, including numerous shots at ICRH power levels > 2 MW.}

Analysis of conditioning cycle on the JET, with its ITER-Like Wall is presented, evidencing reduced need for wall cleaning in ITER compared to JET–CFC. Using a novel 2D multi-fluid model, current density during Glow Discharge Conditioning (GDC) on the in-vessel plasma-facing components (PFC) of ITER is predicted to approach the simple expectation of total anode current divided by wall surface area. Baking of the divertor to 350°C should desorb the majority of the co-deposited T. ITER foresees the use of low temperature plasma based techniques compatible with the permanent toroidal magnetic field, such as Ion (ICWC) or Electron Cyclotron Wall Conditioning (ECWC), for tritium removal between ITER plasma pulses. Extrapolation of JET ICWC results to ITER indicates removal comparable to estimated T-retention in nominal ITER D:T shots, whereas GDC may be unattractive for that purpose.}

The Maxwellian is by far the most widespread model for ions and electrons in tokamaks and stellarators. The bi-Maxwellian and the drifting (bi-)Maxwellian are extensions allowing for anisotropy and bulk plasma flow, respectively. For example, fast ions generated by wave heating in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies are often described by bi-Maxwellians or so-called tail temperatures. The ring distribution can serve as a basic building block for arbitrary distributions or as a bump-on-tail in stability studies. The isotropic slowing-down distribution is a good model for fusion α-particles. The anisotropic slowing-down distribution occurs for anisotropic particle sources as is typical for neutral beam injection. We physically motivate these distribution functions and present analytical models in various coordinate systems commonly used by theorists and experimentalists. We further calculate 1D projections of the distribution functions onto a diagnostic line-of-sight to gain insight into measurements relying on the Doppler shift.}",
