    abstract = {A characterization of plasma parameters and neutral particle energies and fluxes has been performed for radio frequency and microwave discharges in the Toroidal Magnetized System (TOMAS). A movable triple Langmuir probe was used to study the electron densities and temperatures, and a time-of-flight neutral particle analyzer was used to measure the energy and fluxes of neutral particles, as a function of the total injected power and the antenna frequency used to generate the plasma. The experimental results can provide information on the behavior of neutral particles at low energies in wall conditioning plasmas.},

abstract = {Boron and carbon sublime from a boron-doped carbon (3.8% B, Carbon Loraine S1122) like from an independent mixture of the two components. The boron sublimation occurs with an activation energy of 5.3 eV nearly equal to pure boron (5.6 eV). The amount of sublimed boron is 1% of that of pure boron and decreases with time by t−0.5 indicating a diffusion controlled process. This boron-doped carbon contains impurities which are thermally desorbed in peaks centered at the following temperatures: Ca (100 ppm) at 1870 K, O as CO (115 ppm) at 1750 K, Al (83 ppm) at 2050 K, Mg (22 ppm) at 1600 K. The comparison of these sublimation data with the high temperature erosion by ion impact under high flux tokamak conditions results in the following predictions for the release of boron and carbon from boron-doped carbon: Up to 2100 K the erosion is dominated by ion effects (RES, boron sputtering), above 2300 K boron is released mainly by thermal sublimation, the thermal sublimation of carbon reaches at 3000 K the same value as for the carbon release by RES.}
