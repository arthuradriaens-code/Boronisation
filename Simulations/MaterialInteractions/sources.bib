    abstract = {A characterization of plasma parameters and neutral particle energies and fluxes has been performed for radio frequency and microwave discharges in the Toroidal Magnetized System (TOMAS). A movable triple Langmuir probe was used to study the electron densities and temperatures, and a time-of-flight neutral particle analyzer was used to measure the energy and fluxes of neutral particles, as a function of the total injected power and the antenna frequency used to generate the plasma. The experimental results can provide information on the behavior of neutral particles at low energies in wall conditioning plasmas.},
