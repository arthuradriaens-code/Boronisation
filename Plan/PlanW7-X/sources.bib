abstract = {Controlling the recycling of hydrogen and the release of impurities from the plasma facing components proved to be essential and challenging throughout the first divertor campaign on W7-X. This paper discusses the conditioning requirements throughout the first divertor campaign on Wendelstein 7-X. Baking at 150 °C and glow discharge conditioning (GDC) in H2 is performed after the initial pump down of the vacuum vessel. Experimental programs in hydrogen are interlaced with He discharges to desaturate the wall from hydrogen, recover good recycling conditions and hence establish plasma density control. Optimized He ECRH wall conditioning procedures consisted of sequences of short discharges with fixed duty cycle. He-GDC remained however needed before each experimental day to fully offset the hydrogen inventory build-up. A significant increase in the divertor temperature is observed throughout an operational day, enhancing outgassing of CO and H2O. Preliminary recombination-diffusion modelling of hydrogen outgassing suggests enhanced diffusion to deeper surface layers with increasing wall temperature, which results in better wall pumping. This indicates that the experienced plasma performance degradation throughout an operational day results from increased impurity outgassing at higher wall temperature rather than hydrogen saturation of the wall.}

abstract = {The initial conditioning cycle of JET ILW is analysed and compared with restart and operation in 2008 with a carbon dominated wall. Comparable water and oxygen decay times are observed during bake-out in both cases. Despite a 2×10−3mbarl/s leak rate during plasma operation, no further wall conditioning has been necessary after plasma restart in ILW, which dramatically contrasts with 2008. Plasma O content is lower with the ILW. Higher O levels are measured after nights or week-ends, BeO layers being formed and re-eroded, but do not impact plasma operation and performance. First results on isotopic wall changeover by GDC on the ILW six months of the first D2 campaign evidence a reservoir of about 3×1022atoms, i.e. ten time lower than in carbon PFCs. A study in JET of the glow discharge current distribution for different ratios of the ionization mean free paths to the vessel dimensions seems to indicate sufficient toroidal and poloidal homogeneity in ITER.}

title = {Wall conditioning at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator operating with a graphite divertor},
journal = {Physica Scripta},
abstract = {Wall conditioning plays an important role in achieving record plasma performance on the superconducting stellarator Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) by controlling plasma density and maintaining low levels of impurities. The development of the optimal wall conditioning strategy is of high importance for successful operation of the W7-X with a graphite divertor. The current strategy consists of initial wall conditioning applied prior to a physics experimental program and wall conditioning techniques executed during the plasma operation phase. The combination of baking and glow discharge cleaning provides a fast start to reliable plasma operation. Regular boronisation opens a new operational window of high plasma densities above 1 * 1020 m−3. Strong wall fueling remains, however, one of the main issues preventing plasma density control. A reliable solution is provided by application of He electron cyclotron resonance heating pulse trains, which are optimised to maximise fuel removal.}

    abstract = {Discharge wall conditioning is an effective tool to improve plasma performance in tokamaks and stellarators. RF Discharge Conditioning (RFDC) techniques are envisaged for use during operational campaigns on superconducting devices like the ITER tokamak and W7-X stellarator, as alternative to DC Glow Discharge Conditioning which is inefficient in presence of magnetic fields. This contribution investigates RFDC in both the ion and electron cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF and ECRF) on the WEGA device (Max-Planck-Institute for Plasma Physics, Greifswald, Germany) as preparation for W7-X operation. ECRF discharges produced by localised absorption of RF power at EC resonance layers suffer from poor radial discharge homogeneity in the tokamak vacuum magnetic field configuration, severely limiting the plasma wetted wall areas and consequently the conditioning efficiency. The non-localised production of ICRF discharges by collisional RF power absorption features much improved discharge homogeneity making Ion Cyclotron Wall Conditioning (ICWC) the favoured RFDC technique for superconducting tokamaks. RFDC with the stellarator vacuum magnetic field needs to aim at sufficient plasma densities at and outside the last closed flux surface (LCFS), maximising the convective plasma flux along the open field lines to the wall. Whereas for ICRF discharges this condition is easily fulfilled, on WEGA for He-ECRF discharges this could be achieved as well by off axis heating close to the LCFS. In stellarator magnetic field configuration it is found that He-ICWC for wall desaturation is at least one order of magnitude more efficient than He-ECWC. Novel ECWC methods are proposed that can decrease this efficiency gap with ICWC to a factor 2-3. The efficiency difference is less pronounced in case of H2-ICWC and ECWC for isotopic exchange.},
