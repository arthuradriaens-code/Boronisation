\section{Scientific relevance and reasoning}
Glow discharge (GD) in H$_2$ plasma and Electron Cyclotron Wall Conditioning
(ECWC) in He plasma have been actively used on W7-X to condition the wall and
it's effects have been reported (\cite{Goriaev_2020},\cite{WAUTERS2018235} and
EUROFUSION WPS1-PR(16) 16175).

\subsection*{boronized graphite}
Glow discharge erodes the boronized wall, it would be interesting to be 
able to predict to what extend, to this end we will measure ion energy distributions
for different GD settings using the Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA) and expose 
samples for chosen energies. The aim is to then predict with an erosion code like ERO or 
rustBCA the observed erosion. If this is possible, it would showcase the effectiveness
of the erosion codes, enabling it's deployment on W7-X measured fluxes.

\subsection*{hydrogen doped boronized graphite}
W7-X has homogeneous EC wall conditioning in the form of pulse trains.
%ICWC may provide a more efficient cleanup \cite{WEGAIC}. As preparations for
%the possible usage of ICWC in W7-X 
It should be investigated how ECWC performs%and ICWC
in removal from boron-coated graphite, as mentioned in EUROFUSION WPS1-PR(16) 16175, 
ECWC outgassing should follow a time power law ($\propto t^{-0.7}$), 
we wish to observe a similar time law for removal 
to show that TOMAS is equipped for such experiments.
If this is observed, further samples may be prepared to investigate Ion Cycltron Wall
Conditioning.
\section{TOMAS setup and days estimate}
\subsection*{GD}
GD experiments will be carried out on 28 boronized graphite samples, grouped 4
per shot for 7 shots. 4 samples per exposures to have reasonable statistics and
4 exposures for different energies each to have reasonable confidence in the
yield-energy curve form.  Furthermore 4 samples per exposure for 3 exposures
will be conducted for yield-time estimation (should be linear, extra
measurement for validation).
\subsection*{EC}
EC experiments will be carried out on 20 hydrogen-doped boronized graphite
samples, grouped 4 per shot for 6 shots to have sufficient statistics
in outgassing per time and in the observation of the time law.
\subsection*{Both}
The days estimate comes from the possibility to do 2 exposures per day,
with one day of preparatory work, calculated on a maximum of 3 exposure days per week.
During experiments the QMS, the MW interferometer and optical spectroscopy will
be acquiring data.
\section{Sample analysis}
Most of this will be outsourced to experts within FZJ whom will
be credited appropriately. 
On the non-doped samples mainly erosion will be measured while on the doped samples outgassing
will be measured. On the erosion samples other measurements will also be performed
\begin{enumerate}
    \item roughness measurement before and after
    \item (if adequate) ellipsometry before and after
    \item FIBSEM after and on one control
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Roughness measurements}
The exposure to the plasma may give inhomogeneous sputtering which might be
of interest, as such a simple 1D profilometry measurement may be made before
and after exposure, or, if needed, a full 2D surface map. Both of the needed
devices are located in the mirror lab overseen by dr. Litnovsky.
\subsection{Thickness estimate}
Thickness estimates may be made using ellipsometry on the non-doped specimens prior
to the exposure and after exposure prior to being analysed using FIBSEM (dr.Rasinski).
