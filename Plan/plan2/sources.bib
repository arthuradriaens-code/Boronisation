abstract = {Controlling the recycling of hydrogen and the release of impurities from the plasma facing components proved to be essential and challenging throughout the first divertor campaign on W7-X. This paper discusses the conditioning requirements throughout the first divertor campaign on Wendelstein 7-X. Baking at 150 °C and glow discharge conditioning (GDC) in H2 is performed after the initial pump down of the vacuum vessel. Experimental programs in hydrogen are interlaced with He discharges to desaturate the wall from hydrogen, recover good recycling conditions and hence establish plasma density control. Optimized He ECRH wall conditioning procedures consisted of sequences of short discharges with fixed duty cycle. He-GDC remained however needed before each experimental day to fully offset the hydrogen inventory build-up. A significant increase in the divertor temperature is observed throughout an operational day, enhancing outgassing of CO and H2O. Preliminary recombination-diffusion modelling of hydrogen outgassing suggests enhanced diffusion to deeper surface layers with increasing wall temperature, which results in better wall pumping. This indicates that the experienced plasma performance degradation throughout an operational day results from increased impurity outgassing at higher wall temperature rather than hydrogen saturation of the wall.}

abstract = {The initial conditioning cycle of JET ILW is analysed and compared with restart and operation in 2008 with a carbon dominated wall. Comparable water and oxygen decay times are observed during bake-out in both cases. Despite a 2×10−3mbarl/s leak rate during plasma operation, no further wall conditioning has been necessary after plasma restart in ILW, which dramatically contrasts with 2008. Plasma O content is lower with the ILW. Higher O levels are measured after nights or week-ends, BeO layers being formed and re-eroded, but do not impact plasma operation and performance. First results on isotopic wall changeover by GDC on the ILW six months of the first D2 campaign evidence a reservoir of about 3×1022atoms, i.e. ten time lower than in carbon PFCs. A study in JET of the glow discharge current distribution for different ratios of the ionization mean free paths to the vessel dimensions seems to indicate sufficient toroidal and poloidal homogeneity in ITER.}
